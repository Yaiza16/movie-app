## Challenge's description

This project has been done in order to put into practice the knowledge I've been acquiring through React's study. I've used  
[The Movie Database (TMDB) API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) to get all the information.

In this app you can search any movie or serie and get all the information related . Also, you can get information
about any actor or actress playing in the movie.

## Features

- Loading spinner used is from [Single Element CSS Spinners](https://projects.lukehaas.me/css-loaders/)
